### Example application

This is a sample application to show just some of the features of the wurlf software. When clicking on the `example without caching` button, the user will be able to see Three properties about their device.
* Is it a wireless device?
* What is the brand of the software?
* What is the form the device is taking (desktop, tablet, phone? etc)

The `example memcache` button is yet to come.  

#### Realworld Example
* This technology can be used in real life situations in order to optimize user experience as well as processing speed. Depending on the device or the software the user is currently on, you can implement certain features and not others, or limit or enhance certain parts of your application.  This allows a great amount of flexibility and control flow from the developer's standpoint.
